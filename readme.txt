In this project, you can:
play checkers against another person,
play checkers against the computer,
or have 2 computers play against each other.

In this game, you play a slightly modified version of checkers. There are 2 main differences:
You can only jump over one checker per turn (no multi-jumping)
There are no kings/aces (when a checker reaches the end of the board, it can not move).

Also, instead of wight and black, there are 1 and 2 respectively.

To play this game, open command line and cd to the Checkers directory. Then, run "python2 Main.py"
